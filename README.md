Small and interactive game proposed by my smaller brother which allows players to smash eggs for Easter with their friends while social distancing.
The players join a lobby and can challenge each other, controlling the egg with the mouse (only one player gets to control his egg).
The game ends when the eggs smash and one of them is defeated.

Deployed on Firebase, made with Angular on frontend and Node.js for backend
